Welcome to the **curriculum** repository‚Äîa collection of lesson plans, activities, and resources designed to bridge the gap between mathematics and computer science. This repository aims to provide educators with tools to help students conceptualize mathematical functions through the lens of programming and interface design.

## üß† Purpose

This curriculum is crafted to support students, particularly those revisiting Algebra, in understanding mathematical functions as models of real-world scenarios. By framing functions as interfaces between inputs and outputs, students can better grasp the abstraction and application of mathematical concepts.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* **lesson-plans/**: Detailed lesson outlines and objectives.
* **worksheets/**: Student handouts and practice materials.
* **scripts/**: Instructor monologues and teaching scripts.
* **scenarios/**: Real-world problem contexts for classroom discussion.
* **README.md**: Overview and guide to the repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrAllatta/curriculum.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd curriculum
   ```



3. **Explore the materials**:

   * Review lesson plans in the `lesson-plans/` directory.
   * Print or distribute worksheets from the `worksheets/` folder.
   * Use scripts in the `scripts/` directory for classroom instruction.
   * Incorporate real-world scenarios from the `scenarios/` folder into lessons.

## üìö Sample Lesson: Understanding Domain through Interfaces

This lesson introduces the concept of a function's domain by relating it to the inputs of a software interface. Students analyze real-world scenarios, such as a bodega's sandwich pricing, to identify inputs (e.g., amount of money) and outputs (e.g., number of sandwiches), reinforcing the understanding of domain and range in practical contexts.
