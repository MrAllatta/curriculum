## About This Course

**Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning** is a yearlong course designed and taught by Eric Allatta for the NYC Museum School. It introduces 9th grade students to computer science not as a set of tools, but as a discipline of thought.

We begin with structure. Then we move through data, systems, and interpretation. By the end, students know how to write code—but more importantly, they know how to think in computational systems, express ideas through logic, and make meaning with design.

The course is grounded in:
- Functional programming and reasoning-first pedagogy
- Data modeling, ethics, and interpretation
- Real-world tools like HTML, APIs, and Jupyter
- Inquiry, agency, and intellectual clarity

### Course Units
