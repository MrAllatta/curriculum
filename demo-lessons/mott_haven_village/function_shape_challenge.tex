For each scenario below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the output.
\item Predict the shape of the graph (linear, exponential, quadratic, piecewise, etc.).
\item Briefly explain why you chose that shape.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item A savings account earns 5% interest compounded yearly.
\item A ball is thrown upward and falls back to the ground.
\item A parking garage charges \$10 for the first hour and \$3 for every additional hour.
\item A person walks away from their house, pauses, and returns home at a slower pace.
\item The population of a new bacteria culture triples every 2 hours.
\end{itemize}

\small\textit{What does the graph look like? What does the function tell you about how the output changes?}
