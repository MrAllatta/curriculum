# Policy on Generative AI Use — Families

Your student is in a course that meets the moment: one where AI is a real tool, not a forbidden trick.

We teach students to use these tools *with discernment*. The goal isn’t speed or automation. It’s deeper thinking, stronger judgment, and ownership of ideas.

Let’s be clear: **the foundational nature of learning and literacy has not changed**. Students still need to read, reason, write, and revise. What’s changed is the **burden on discernment**, which has increased exponentially in the presence of generative tools.

In practice, this means:
- Students may use generative AI tools, but must submit prompts and outputs alongside their work.
- Writing by hand is encouraged, especially during learning and assessment.
- Asking AI thoughtful questions during problem-solving is supported.
- Submitting AI-written work as their own is not.

The course is designed to detect shallow understanding. Students will regularly:
- Present and defend ideas aloud
- Complete pencil-and-paper assessments without tech assistance

We appreciate your support in reinforcing that these tools are powerful—but only when used responsibly.
