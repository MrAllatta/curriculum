# Programming by Design: Course Overview + Strategic Pathways

**Course Title:** Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning
**Grade Level:** 9th Grade
**Format:** Yearlong, Modular, Project-Based
**Instructor:** Eric Allatta

---

## Course Overview

This course treats computer science as a discipline of design, logic, and interpretation—not just syntax or application. Students begin with structure, build through data, and extend to systems thinking, human-computer interaction, and inquiry through code. The goal is not just for students to write code, but to think with clarity, test their logic, and communicate their ideas in public-facing forms.

**Guiding Principles:**

* Programming is a language for structured thinking
* Data is never neutral—it must be interpreted and questioned
* Systems must be tested, visualized, and explained
* Good code is communicative: to machines *and* to people

## Conceptual Arc

| Unit | Focus                         | Tool/Language            |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | Computing as Communication    | Concepts + History       |
| 2    | Functional Design             | Racket                   |
| 3    | Data Science + Representation | Pyret                    |
| 4    | Control + State               | Python + EarSketch       |
| 5    | Interfaces + Interpretation   | HTML/CSS                 |
| 6    | Inquiry + Real Data           | APIs + Jupyter           |
| 7    | Infrastructure + Power        | Internet Simulator + CLI |
| 8    | Capstone                      | Student Choice           |

## Strategic Pathways

This course is designed as a launchpad—not a terminal experience. Students are prepared for multiple rigorous next steps:

### **1. AP Computer Science A**

* Strong foundation in control flow, state, and decomposition
* Transition to OOP and Java syntax built on solid habits

### **2. Data Science + AP Capstone Track**

* Literate computing and real inquiry via Jupyter and APIs
* Ethical analysis and project framing embedded throughout

### **3. Algebra 2 + Computing Integration**

* Tight alignment with function modeling, logic, and recursive structure
* Reinforces algebraic thinking through real applications

## Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:

* Write, test, and debug code across languages and paradigms
* Build and explain simulations, visualizations, and interfaces
* Analyze the structure and ethics of real-world computing systems
* Complete a capstone project that demonstrates reasoning, technical skill, and interpretive clarity

This is not a showcase course. It’s a thinking course.
And it’s built to last.
