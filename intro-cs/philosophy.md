# Course Philosophy

This section of the curriculum site houses the foundational thinking behind every decision in the course. These are not lesson plans. These are not standards checklists. These are the *premises, tensions, and commitments* that shape how and why we teach Intro to CS this way.

We teach real students in real schools. Our classrooms are noisy, brilliant, uneven, and human. These pages explain how we design a course that is:

* Technically rigorous without being exclusive
* Rooted in habits of thought, not tricks of syntax
* Transparent about its structure and purpose
* Scaffolded for reflection, revision, and real learning
* Focused on long-term fluency, not short-term performance

## Philosophy Pages

### ðŸ”¹ [All Students Must, Some Students Might](goals_prioritization.md)

How we prioritize learning goals without lowering expectations. Class time is preciousâ€”this page outlines what *every* student must do, and what *some* students might achieve.

### ðŸ”¹ [The Story of Unit 0](unit0_design_story.md)

A narrative walkthrough of the first ten lessonsâ€”not in bullets, but as a teaching experience. We plan for structure, confusion, insight, and culture.

### ðŸ”¹ [ThreadMap â€“ Conceptual Threads](../unit_0/threadmap.md)

Not every idea lives in a single lesson. This map shows how concepts, tools, and habits recur and spiral forward.

### ðŸ”¹ \[More Coming Soon]

Future pages will explore: why we teach journaling, how we frame AI as literacy, and what it means to center systems thinking in a 9th-grade course.

These documents are both internal and public-facing. They help orient new teachers, explain our logic to admin, and clarify our values to anyone reviewing the course.

This is where the real thinking lives. And itâ€™s always in progress.
