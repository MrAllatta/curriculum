# The Story of Unit 0 – Designing the First 10 Days

Unit 0 is not a warm-up. It is a *reckoning*. It doesn’t teach programming; it teaches why programming exists. It lays the foundation for everything: structure before syntax, reflection before recursion, identity before implementation.

This page tells the *teaching story* of Unit 0—not a list of outcomes, but what students *experience* and why. It is narrative backward design: each lesson imagined as lived time in a real classroom with real students.

This version reflects the original 10-lesson sequence, now seen as a living archive. We expect the sequence to evolve.

## Lesson-by-Lesson Teaching Story

### 0.1 — What is Computing?

Disorientation is the goal. Students are asked to define what a computer is. The answers are foggy, literal, wildly inconsistent. They draw mental models. You show how different their assumptions are. The first big idea lands: **computing is a system we invented to express intention structurally.**

### 0.2 — The Human Algorithm

Students write directions for a peer to follow. The class devolves into chaos. Instructions are too vague. Interpretation goes sideways. It’s funny—and it’s foundational. They feel the consequences of imprecision. You introduce “algorithm” not as code, but as a mindset: exact steps, minimal assumptions.

### 0.3 — System Thinking I

Students dissect something familiar: vending machine, subway card reader, or a lunch line. They diagram inputs, processes, and outputs. It’s the first time they realize *systems* aren’t abstract—they’re everywhere. You’re building a visual grammar they’ll use for the rest of the course.

### 0.4 — Binary + Encoding

This lesson lands hard. Students try to pass messages using symbolic rules. They fail—until they agree on structure. Then they succeed. The metaphor is clear: **meaning lives in convention.** You tie it to binary, bits, and machine interpretation. They feel the human behind the machine.

### 0.5 — Historical Spotlight

You ground the work in people. Ada Lovelace. Grace Hopper. Alan Turing. Students read and respond. They realize computing has a *history*—and that history has been shaped by war, gender, invention, and erasure. Cultural critique enters the course without apology.

### 0.6 — Representation + Bias

From history to systems of power. Students explore how museums, search engines, or datasets preserve some truths and erase others. They analyze what gets encoded and excluded. You connect this to computing: **systems are not neutral.** It’s a hard lesson for some. But it sticks.

### 0.7 — System Thinking II

The diagrams return—but this time students choose their own systems. Morning routines, school policies, TikTok. They build them, critique them, and refine. The focus shifts from decoding systems to modeling them. You introduce naming conventions. You reinforce clarity as kindness.

### 0.8 — Logic + Constraint Reasoning

You introduce puzzles: logic grids, deduction games, constraint-based challenges. It’s fun. It’s frustrating. It’s *algorithmic thinking* without a computer. Students begin to experience constraint as creative—not limiting. A critical concept for later programming work.

### 0.9 — Assessment Studio

Assessment isn’t a quiz—it’s a studio. Students submit system diagrams, vocabulary usage, or blog posts. They make choices about how to show what they understand. You circulate, prompt, and challenge. Reflection becomes visible. You treat student work as *thinking*, not performance.

### 0.10 — Reflection + Framing

The unit ends with a loop. Students revisit their Day 1 definitions. They read journals. They write about what changed—and why. You project the course’s Big Ideas. You ask them to name one in their own words. Some speak. Some write. Some surprise you. The class exhales.

## Design Insights

This unit is overfull. And that’s the point. It is not about mastery. It is about **exposure, ritual, and orientation**. These ten days are dense so the rest of the course can breathe. We set up habits now—journaling, reflecting, diagramming, naming, critiquing—that we will use again and again.

This unit assumes **variable pacing, wide skill ranges, and diverse starting points.** It is built to ground students without sorting them.

We will revise this lesson structure. But the *story*—what students feel, try, fail at, and begin to believe—is what must endure.

This is how the course begins.
