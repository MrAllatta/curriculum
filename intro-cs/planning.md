# Planning

This section contains the internal-facing curriculum planning documents that support consistent, reflective, and flexible implementation of the Intro to Computer Science course.

These materials are for instructors, coaches, and curriculum designers. They include assessment maps, facilitator guides, grading structures, and planning scaffolds to support course delivery in real classrooms.

Where the “Policies” section presents the course publicly, this section presents the *machinery*—the logic and infrastructure that keep the course coherent.
