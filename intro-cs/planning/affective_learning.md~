# Affective Learning Appendix

## On Judgement, Structure, and Belonging in Computing

Learning to program is not just technical.  
It is emotional. It is identity work. It is about safety and risk.

Computer science as it is typically framed—both in school and in the industry—carries connotations of judgment:
- Error messages feel personal.
- Success is often framed as innate talent.
- Students compare themselves against others who "just get it."

This dynamic activates a core set of emotional blockers:
- **Imposter syndrome**
- **Inferiority**
- **Not belonging**
- **I can’t learn this**
- **My brain doesn’t work this way**

We recognize these not as side effects, but as **central barriers to learning**.

## Our Response: Design Over Tinkering

We teach with **structure**.  
We use design pedagogy because it equalizes access—not because it simplifies the content, but because it clarifies the path.

Our approach emphasizes:
- Design recipes
- Contracts and examples
- Systematic debugging
- Progressive layers of abstraction

These practices give all students a map.  
They allow students who "get it" to **slow down and explain**, and students who struggle to **see the shape of the problem**.

We do not romanticize unstructured “play.”  
We build foundational thinking habits that empower creativity, not replace it.

## Structured Thinking Enables Creativity

This course includes creative elements: personal projects, museum connections, music, web design, and open-ended exploration.  
But these are not the pedagogy. They are the **fruit** of the pedagogy.

Freedom without clarity leads to confusion.  
Structure enables students to make choices with purpose.

## Belonging Is the Goal

We teach coding to help students understand systems, express ideas, and build confidence in their own intellectual power.  
We work against the idea that CS is only for a certain kind of brain, background, or personality.

Belonging is not something students earn once they’re “good at it.”  
Belonging is something we **build into the structure** of the course.

Every routine. Every project. Every error message.  
Every student.

They belong here.
