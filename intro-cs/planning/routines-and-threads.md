## Routines and Threads Reference
*Programming by Design: Embedded Practices for Coherence and Clarity*

This document outlines instructional routines and thematic threads that run across the course. These are not isolated lessonsâ€”they are **habits of mind** and **structures of experience** that make the course coherent, reflective, and intellectually rigorous.

---

### Weekly Routines
These short, repeatable structures appear in multiple units to build fluency, reflection, and interpretation.

#### ðŸ“° Computing in the News
- One short article or tweet per week
- Students annotate, question, and discuss its implications
- Builds habit of relating CS to systems, ethics, and the world

#### ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s Going On in This Graph?
- Inspired by NYT learning prompts
- Students analyze a visual (chart, infographic, or data excerpt)
- Focus on clarity, storytelling, and interpretationâ€”not just correctness

#### ðŸ““ Code + Journal Pairing
- Students reflect on their logic, process, and errors
- Used after design recipe, debugging, or presentation tasks
- Connects affective learning to technical learning

### Conceptual Threads
Themes that recur through content, projects, and assessments. These are seeded early and deepened across time.

#### 1. **Structure Before Syntax**
- Focus first on habits of thought: decomposition, generalization, precision
- Minimize noise of curly braces and configuration in early units
- Elevate design clarity and testing mindset

#### 2. **Data as Argument**
- From Unit 1: Data is never raw; itâ€™s modeled, filtered, framed
- Emphasized in Units 3, 6, and Capstone
- Students interpret, critique, and re-frame representations

#### 3. **Code as Communication**
- Code isnâ€™t just for machinesâ€”itâ€™s for humans
- Documenting, naming, and presenting matter as much as execution
- Design for interpretation appears in Units 2, 5, and 8

#### 4. **Power and Infrastructure**
- Who owns the systems? Who defines the categories?
- Recurs in metadata ethics, network protocols, and project framing
- Drives questions in Units 1, 3, 6, and 7

### Why These Matter
These threads keep the course from becoming a disjointed sequence of tools. They give students language to ask questions, strategies to build responsibly, and the ability to transfer thinking across contexts.

Routines build *discipline*. Threads build *meaning*.
Together, they build *coherence*.
