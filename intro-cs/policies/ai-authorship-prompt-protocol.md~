# AI Authorship Prompt Protocol

This protocol supports student reflection and accountability when using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) in the production of any written or coded artifact.

**The core question is not: Did you use AI?**
It’s: **How did your use of AI shape your thinking, and can you prove it?**

This document outlines the reflection, submission, and self-evaluation process for any AI-assisted work.

## 🧾 Submission Components

Every AI-assisted artifact must include:

### 1. **Prompt Log**

A record of actual prompts used in the process. This is not optional. It must:

* Include at least 3 prompts
* Include both “successful” and “useless” attempts
* Show iteration or escalation (not just one prompt and copy-paste)

**Example Format:**

```markdown
Prompt Log: System Diagram Project
1. "How do you explain the difference between a process and a feedback loop in a system?"
2. "List metaphors for systems thinking that a 9th grader might understand."
3. "Rewrite this explanation using student-friendly language."
```

### 2. **Reflection on Effectiveness**

Write 1–2 paragraphs answering:

* What did the AI get right?
* What did it miss or mess up?
* What did *you* have to bring to the process to make the output meaningful?

### 3. **“Should-Have” Prompt Set** *(optional but diabolically illuminating)*

Based on your final artifact, write 2–3 prompts your future self *should* have used to generate deeper or clearer thinking. This helps surface gaps between intention and outcome.

**Meta-Prompt (you can use this to generate should-haves):**

> “Look at this artifact. What prompts would have led me to something more precise, insightful, or rigorous?”

## 🧠 What This Teaches

* Prompts are **evidence of process**
* AI use requires **discernment and editing**
* Revision is not just about text—it’s about *questions asked*

Students learn that writing with AI is not shortcutting—it’s shaping. Prompts are the intellectual fingerprints of their work.

## 🔍 Instructor Checkpoints

Use the following when reviewing prompt logs:

| Signal                        | What It Shows                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple attempts             | Student is iterating, not offloading               |
| Specific prompts              | Student understands the tool, not just the topic   |
| “Why” reflection              | Student is noticing bias, vagueness, or overreach  |
| Self-generated “should-haves” | Student is building discernment, not faking output |

## 💡 Classroom Use

* Introduce with your **AI Policy Rollout Lesson** (Unit 0)
* Apply to blogs, diagrams, technical docs, and any AI-touched work
* Use samples (real and fake) to model what strong prompt logs look like
* Revisit midyear as AI habits evolve

Prompts are the new paragraphs.
Let’s teach students to write them with care—and read them like critics.
