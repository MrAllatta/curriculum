# Structured Out-of-Class Routines

This page defines and supports the recurring out-of-class routines introduced in Unit 0. These routines extend classroom learning, build fluency through repetition, and make space for student autonomy. They are structured, low-friction, and explicitly taught.

These routines are designed to:

* Provide practice opportunities for durable skills
* Reinforce classroom thinking through metacognitive writing
* Create flexible, asynchronous entry points to complex tools
* Allow students to progress at their own pace, with accountability

## 📂 Bash Dungeon (Shell Fluency)

A text-based command line practice game. Each student progresses through levels at their own pace. This is the foundation for all future CLI work.

* **Goal:** Develop comfort with file navigation, commands, and naming conventions
* **Frequency:** Weekly checkpoint or mission
* **Scaffold:** Dungeon map PDF, tutorial video, cheat sheet
* **Assessment:** Progress log + student reflection (“what did I break this week?”)

---

## 📝 Weekly Journals (Reflection + Thinking Practice)

A recurring reflection ritual. Students respond to a prompt that invites them to explain, reflect, or narrate their learning process.

* **Goal:** Build fluency in structured thought and metacognition
* **Frequency:** 1x/week (minimum)
* **Format:** Markdown in blog or Google Doc
* **Prompts:** Rotating (from prompt bank), e.g.,

  * “Where did I guess, and what happened?”
  * “What’s one thing I noticed in the world differently this week?”
  * “What structure helped me understand something better?”

## 📚 Readings + Blog Responses

Students read short pieces on computing history, systems, or equity, then post a response in their blog. Prompts focus on connection, curiosity, and critique.

* **Goal:** Develop cultural context + voice in tech
* **Frequency:** 2–3 readings in Unit 0
* **Examples:**

  * Article on Grace Hopper’s clock
  * Timelines of computing milestones
  * Museum exhibits as data systems

---

## 🤖 AI Practice Logs

As students begin interacting with generative AI, they are required to keep a log of prompts, outputs, and evaluations.

* **Goal:** Build discernment and authorship norms
* **Start:** After Lesson 0.4 (encoding + meaning)
* **Entries include:**

  * Initial prompt
  * Output (with commentary)
  * What they kept, discarded, revised

---

## 🧠 Diagram Revision Bank

Students save, revise, and annotate systems diagrams. Some lessons will involve resubmitting previous maps with improvements.

* **Goal:** Develop visual precision and iterative design habits
* **Frequency:** Optional, with required checkpoints
* **Artifacts:** Pre/post diagrams with annotation

---

## Norms for Out-of-Class Work

* **All routines are taught explicitly in class before independent work begins.**
* **Students are given visual and written scaffolds for each task.**
* **Feedback is low-stakes but structured: checklists, short comments, peer tags.**
* **Students may revisit and revise any artifact at any time.**

These routines are not “homework” in the traditional sense. They are the **long-term fluency builders** that allow class time to focus on framing, modeling, and collective sense-making.
