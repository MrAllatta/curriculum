# Intro to CS Syllabus

**Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning**  
*Grade Level: 9th | Full Year | Modular, Inquiry-Driven, Project-Based*

---

## Course Philosophy

This course introduces students to computer science as a discipline of **structured thought**, grounded in reasoning, systems design, and ethical inquiry. Code is taught not as syntax but as **a medium for structure, logic, and clarity**.

Students move from mental models and abstraction, to pure functions and data systems, to real-world computational expression through interfaces, networks, and public work.

## Units & Concepts

| Unit | Title | Framing Concept |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 0 | [The Story of Data](/intro-cs/unit-0-story-of-data.html) | Programming is communication between humans and machines. |
| 1 | [Programming by Design (Racket)](/intro-cs/unit-1-design-racket.html) | A program is a structured solution to a problem. |
| 2 | [Data Science and Representation (Pyret)](/intro-cs/unit-2-data-science-pyret.html) | Data is a constructed lens on the world. |
| 3 | [Systems and Control (Python + EarSketch)](/intro-cs/unit-3-systems-python.html) | Programs model dynamic systems through control flow and state. |
| 4 | [Interface and Communication (HTML + CSS)](/intro-cs/unit-4-interface-and-communication.html) | Code is interpretation—computational ideas need an audience. |
| 5 | [Code in the Wild (APIs + Jupyter)](/intro-cs/unit-5-code-in-the-wild.html) | Code lives in systems, documents itself, and pulls from the web. |
| 6 | [Networks, Protocols, and Power](/intro-cs/unit-6-networks-protocols-power.html) | The internet is a system of abstractions that shapes global power. |
| 7 | [Capstone Projects](/intro-cs/unit-7-capstone.html) | What can you build, explain, and defend? |

## Toolchain & Language Progression

| Phase | Tools & Languages | Focus |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Weeks 0–1 | Markdown, terminal, folder hygiene | Naming, abstraction, structure |
| Unit 1 | Racket (HtDP) | Functional reasoning, recursion |
| Unit 2 | Pyret (Bootstrap:Data Science) | Tables, filtering, inference |
| Unit 3 | Python + EarSketch | Loops, state, simulation, systems |
| Unit 4 | HTML + CSS | Interpretation, interface, audience |
| Unit 5 | Jupyter + REST APIs | Documentation, reproducibility, real data |
| Unit 6 | Terminal, IP/DNS/HTTP simulation | Protocols, metadata, infrastructure |
| Unit 7 | Open choice | Mixed tools, student agency, integration |

## Threaded Routines & Practices

➡️ [See Full Reference](/intro_cs/intro_cs_routines_and_threads.md)

- **Computing in the News** – weekly current event literacy
- **What’s Going On in This Graph?** – visual data interpretation
- **Journaling + Code Pairing** – reflection on process and precision
- **Meta-discussion** – regular “thinking about thinking” spaces
- **File Discipline** – consistent naming and structural habits

---

## Assessment Structure

➡️ [See Full Assessment Map](/intro_cs/intro_cs_assessment_map.md)

Assessments focus on **reasoning, clarity, and self-awareness**:
- Diagrams, contracts, and debug tasks
- Peer critiques and code reviews
- Notebooks, reflection writing, and system modeling
- Capstone: final artifact, documentation, and defense

---

## Pathway Alignment

This course is not isolated—it’s a **gateway into systems-level computational fluency**.

| Pathway | Emphasis |
|---------|----------|
| **AP CS A** | Prepares students for structured OOP and formal algorithms |
| **Data Science Capstone** | Builds toward reproducible, investigatory computing |
| **Algebra 2 + Computing** | Strengthens function modeling and logic across contexts |

Students exit this course with transferable habits for math, writing, and interdisciplinary inquiry—not just “coding skills.”
