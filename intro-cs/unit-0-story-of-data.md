## Unit 0: The Story of Data

**Framing Concept: Programming is communication between humans and machines.**

### Unit Overview

This unit establishes the foundation for the course—both intellectually and culturally. Students explore the idea that computing is not just technical but human: a system of structured communication invented to reconcile the gap between intention and execution. Through cultural analysis, systems modeling, and critical discussion, students begin to build shared language and habits for structured thinking, representation, and reasoning.

The unit also seeds the course’s routines and meta-practices, giving students tools to interpret data, reflect on their own thinking, and relate computational ideas to human contexts.

No programming is introduced in this unit. Instead, students focus on how information is structured, how systems work, and how computational metaphors shape the way we think.

### Essential Questions

* What is computation, and why does it exist?
* How do computers interpret instructions?
* What is data, and how does it gain meaning?
* Who has shaped the field of computing, and whose stories are missing?
* How do we begin to reason about problems structurally?

### Core Learning Goals

* Build conceptual understanding of computing as a human-centered system
* Explore the cultural and historical origins of computer science
* Learn foundational vocabulary and metaphors of systems, data, and abstraction
* Establish classroom habits: critical analysis, precision, structured expression
* Begin diagramming systems and expressing structured instructions (algorithms)

### Key Activities

* **The Human Algorithm Game** – Students write and perform step-by-step directions to simulate procedural thinking and precision.
* **What is a Computer?** – Concept mapping + collaborative critique to surface assumptions and mental models.
* **Historical Spotlight** – Students engage with the work of Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper to examine identity and vision in early computing.
* **Binary and Machine Language Simulation** – Explore how meaning is encoded and decoded; connect human and machine interpretations.
* **System Walkthroughs** – Students analyze familiar real-world systems to identify inputs, processes, and outcomes.

### Lessons

1. Lesson 0.1 – What is Computing?
2. Lesson 0.2 – The Human Algorithm
3. Lesson 0.3 – System Thinking I
4. Lesson 0.4 – Binary + Encoding
5. Lesson 0.5 – Historical Spotlight
6. Lesson 0.6 – Representation + Bias
7. Lesson 0.7 – System Thinking II
8. Lesson 0.8 – Logic + Constraint Thinking
9. Lesson 0.9 – Assessment Studio
10. Lesson 0.10 – Reflection + Framing

### Extension Opportunities

* Analyze a museum exhibit as a data system: what is preserved, omitted, or emphasized?
* Write a prompt for a generative AI system. What makes a prompt successful or ambiguous?
* Build a “thinking tool” that translates a human request into simple steps (pseudocode, diagram, or language model)
* Use a logic grid puzzle as a metaphor for constraint-based reasoning

### Assessment + Reflection

* **Diagram Task** – Visualize a system or process with clear components and relationships.
* **Vocabulary Check** – Define and use foundational concepts (abstraction, algorithm, encoding, system).
* **Journal Writing** – Reflect on structure, communication, and what it means to "think computationally."
* **Participation Rubric** – Evaluate engagement in discussion, analysis, and meta-reflection.
* **Meta-Project: What I Thought a Computer Was – And Why It Matters** – Scaffolded reflection that asks students to track and revise their concept of computing over the course of the unit (DOK 1–4).

### Pedagogical Threads

* Weekly journals + blogs build long-form reflection and meta-reasoning
* Command line and GitHub blog setup introduce text and system fluency
* Class blog writing in markdown via Jekyll or Overleaf
* Intro to structured thinking: mapping, modeling, and describing systems precisely
* Scaffolds include sentence starters, pre-filled diagrams, audio and visual reading options

### End-of-Unit Statement

By the end of Unit 0, students recognize that computing is not about devices—it’s about structured thought. They begin to understand that programming is not a natural talent but a learned practice, rooted in logic, context, and communication. They leave the unit equipped with vocabulary, frameworks, and confidence to begin designing structured solutions.
