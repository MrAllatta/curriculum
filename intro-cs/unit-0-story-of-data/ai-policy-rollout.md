# Lesson Plan — Communicating and Owning AI Policy

## Grade Level
9th Grade

## Duration
1 class period (45–60 minutes)

## Objectives
- Students will understand the classroom policy on generative AI.
- Students will articulate personal positions and practices related to AI use.
- Students will reflect on the cognitive demands of using AI responsibly.
- Students will observe and discuss real practices for managing AI volume.

## Materials
- Printed or digital copies of the "Student AI Policy"
- Slides or board with key quotes (from "Poster Text Snippets")
- Teacher file system example (folder structure, annotated screenshots, or live demo)
- Optional: anonymous student survey or response cards

## Do Now (5 min)
**Prompt:** “Have you ever used an AI tool to write something? What was the result?”  
Students write a brief private response.

## Mini-Lecture (10–15 min)
Use direct instruction to walk through the **AI policy**. Emphasize:
- The **unchanged foundations** of cognition, learning, and literacy
- The **exponential rise in the burden of discernment**
- That **AI output is not neutral**—bad AI text is a pollutant
- That **short prompts = dead output**, and readers can feel it

> “An educated person feels contempt welling up from their soul when they read dead AI text.”

Frame the idea that responsible use of AI involves a *lot* of input (prompting), and even more **critical reading**.

## Demo + Share (10 min)
Show your file system or tagging method for handling AI volume:
- Separate folders for draft, raw output, annotated feedback
- Examples of long prompts and multi-step prompting sessions
- Explain how much output is never used—and *why*

Connect this to the principle: **if you're going to use AI to generate text, you'd better be ready to sift and discard 90% of it.**

## Student Reflection + Share Out (15–20 min)
**Prompt:** “How do you think AI could be helpful in this class—*if* it’s used well?”
- Think-pair-share
- Invite a few students to share with the full group

Facilitate discussion around:
- What good prompting looks like
- The difference between *asking* a question and *offloading* the work
- What kind of AI use would actually help you grow judgment

Optional: collect student thoughts anonymously for follow-up.

## Exit Ticket (5 min)
**Prompt:** “What’s one thing you’re willing to try—or change—about your use of AI this semester?”

## Assessment
Informal: observation of student engagement, discussion clarity, exit ticket content.
Formal: incorporation of AI policy language and expectations into upcoming assignments.

## Notes
- Keep tone candid and direct—don’t oversell AI or over-police it.
- Model the level of clarity and effort you expect from them.
- Return to this lesson when you see sloppy AI work show up. Refer to the principle of **digital pollution**.

## Follow-Up
- Add oral defense checkpoints in assignments
- Ask students to reflect on their prompt quality before turning in AI-assisted work
- Use folder/tag protocols to build AI process literacy over time
