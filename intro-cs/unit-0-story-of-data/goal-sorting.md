# Unit 0 Goal Sorting ‚Äî Class Time vs Offline Time

This document identifies which goals in Unit 0 require in-class time and which can be practiced outside of class. Each goal is classified by:

* **Thread** ‚Äî Technical, Cognitive, or Affective
* **Class Time** ‚Äî Whether this needs structured teacher time
* **Must/Might** ‚Äî Whether all students must reach this goal or only some might
* **Offramp** ‚Äî Where or how the student continues to engage with the goal

This matrix supports backward design and helps prioritize classroom energy. The structure allows flexible adaptation across diverse learners, pacing realities, and classroom conditions.

## Summary: What Class Time Is For

* Ritualizing routines (journals, diagrams, feedback, reflection)
* Modeling tools (CLI, Git, Markdown)
* Establishing cultural foundation (history, equity, authorship)
* Surfacing and discussing misunderstanding
* Giving students durable thinking structures to rehearse over time

## Summary: What Happens Outside Class

* Skill fluency through repetition (bash, markdown)
* Self-reflection + journaling
* Prompt practice (AI logs, critiques)
* Reading + viewing media (on history, systems, bias)
* Scaffolding student autonomy with support materials

This is not a division of importance. It's a division of *temporal bandwidth*. We teach in class what must be seen and shared. We reinforce out of class what must be practiced and internalized.
