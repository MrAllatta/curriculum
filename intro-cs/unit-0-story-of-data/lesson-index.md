# Original Lesson Sketches – Archive & Reference

This page preserves the original Unit 0 lesson sequence, written before full backward design and restructuring. It represents the earliest sketch of the unit's conceptual arc—narrative, not prescriptive. Some lessons will be renamed, condensed, split, or rethreaded.

---

## 0.1 — What is Computing?

**Goal:** Introduce computing as a human system of structured communication.
**Experience:** Students generate mental models of what a computer is. The wide variance leads to shared disorientation and the first big question: what *is* computing for?
**Thread focus:** Systems thinking (I), abstraction (I), meta-reasoning (I)

---

## 0.2 — The Human Algorithm

**Goal:** Reveal the need for precision in structured instructions.
**Experience:** Students write and follow each other’s directions. Chaos. Misinterpretation. Then discussion of what makes directions “computational.”
**Thread focus:** Algorithmic thinking (I), abstraction (R), self-efficacy through error (R)

---

## 0.3 — System Thinking I

**Goal:** Surface shared vocabulary for identifying and analyzing systems.
**Experience:** Dissect vending machines, turnstiles, or school routines. Diagram inputs, processes, and outputs.
**Thread focus:** Systems thinking (R), diagramming (I), meta-reasoning (R)

---

## 0.4 — Binary + Encoding

**Goal:** Introduce symbolic meaning-making and how information is encoded.
**Experience:** Symbol games or encoding exercises lead to discussion of binary, convention, and machine interpretation.
**Thread focus:** Shell intro (I), encoding (I), abstraction (R), authorship (I)

---

## 0.5 — Historical Spotlight

**Goal:** Humanize the history of CS and introduce erased narratives.
**Experience:** Spotlight Grace Hopper, Ada Lovelace, Turing. Timeline work or annotated reading.
**Thread focus:** Representation (I), authorship (R), self-efficacy (I), journaling/blogging (X)

---

## 0.6 — Representation + Bias

**Goal:** Connect systems thinking to cultural critique.
**Experience:** Analyze museum exhibits or data platforms as designed systems. What is preserved? What is erased?
**Thread focus:** Representation (I), AI critique (R), diagramming (R), blog writing (X)

---

## 0.7 — System Thinking II

**Goal:** Apply systems modeling to self-chosen contexts.
**Experience:** Students create and revise diagrams of systems from their lives (class schedules, social media, etc.)
**Thread focus:** Diagramming (R), abstraction (R), systems thinking (R)

---

## 0.8 — Logic + Constraint Reasoning

**Goal:** Practice constraint-based problem-solving and structured deduction.
**Experience:** Logic puzzles, grid games, constraint modeling—no computers, just thinking tools.
**Thread focus:** Algorithmic logic (R), meta-reasoning (R), confidence via problem-solving (R)

---

## 0.9 — Assessment Studio

**Goal:** Synthesize understanding of Unit 0 concepts.
**Experience:** Choose from performance options: diagrams, writing, blogging, visual explanation. Studio format with peer feedback.
**Thread focus:** Meta-reflection (R), diagramming (R), representation (R), authorship (R)

---

## 0.10 — Reflection + Framing

**Goal:** Make conceptual threads visible and personal.
**Experience:** Students revisit Day 1 ideas, complete reflection writing, and discuss big ideas aloud. This is the “contract” moment before Unit 1 begins.
**Thread focus:** Reflection (I), authorship (R), self-efficacy (R), routines (R)

This archive is meant to capture the *spirit* of the first full pass at lesson structure. It will inform revision but not dictate final form. The design will evolve, but the teaching story—what students felt, touched, built, and questioned—remains the anchor.
