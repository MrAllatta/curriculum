# Welcome to Unit 0 – The Story of Data

You’re not just here to “learn to code.” You’re here to learn to think like a builder, a designer, a system-mapper, and a meaning-maker. Programming is only one way of expressing those skills.

Before you write any code, we’re going to slow down and ask: **What is computing, really?**

This unit will feel different. It’s not about getting everything “right.” It’s about starting to notice. Starting to think about your thinking. Starting to see structure.

## What This Unit Is About

Unit 0 is called *The Story of Data* because it introduces computing as a human story. We explore where it came from, why it was invented, who invented it—and who got erased from the story. We think about how computers *interpret* human instructions, and how humans try to make those instructions make sense.

We also start building new habits: diagramming, journaling, naming our thoughts, and asking questions.

You won’t be expected to master every tool yet—but you will start to understand *why* we use them.

## Big Ideas That Guide This Course

These are posted on the wall. These are the truths we return to.

* **Structure before syntax** — If you understand the pattern, the code will follow.
* **Code is communication** — You’re not just talking to a computer. You’re talking to other people.
* **Computing is cultural** — Every system reflects its designers. That includes biases.
* **Mistakes are required** — Learning means trying. Confusion is part of the path.
* **Precision is power** — The clearer you are, the more control you have.
* **You are the author** — AI doesn’t think. *You* do.

## What You’ll Do in Unit 0

You’ll:

* Explore what a computer *really* is
* Write and perform human algorithms
* Draw system diagrams of real-world processes
* Play logic and constraint puzzles
* Learn the basics of command line and markdown
* Begin blogging and journaling about your thinking
* Reflect on computing’s past and your place in its future

## What You’re Responsible For

You are not expected to be “good at computers.” There’s no such thing. What you *are* expected to do is:

* Try things you don’t fully understand yet
* Practice weekly: journals, blogs, Bash Dungeon
* Reflect on what you’re learning and how
* Ask questions, share your thinking, revise your work

We don’t grade perfection. We grade presence, persistence, and thoughtfulness.

## What Success Looks Like (for now)

By the end of Unit 0, you should be able to:

* Describe what computing is *for*
* Diagram a system and explain how it works
* Explain what version control is (even if you don’t use Git yet)
* Use a command line to navigate folders and run basic commands
* Reflect on a mistake you made and what you learned from it
* Start thinking critically about AI and authorship

## Why This Matters

You live in a world built by systems. Some of them are clear. Some of them are hidden. Learning computer science is not just about writing code—it’s about understanding how the systems around you work, and how you can change them.

Unit 0 is where that journey begins.
