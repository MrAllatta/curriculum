# ThreadMap – Conceptual Threads Across Unit 0

This document maps the conceptual threads of Unit 0 across the original ten-lesson arc. Threads are categorized across four dimensions:

* **Technical** – Tools and fluencies: shell, Git, markup, diagrams
* **Cognitive** – Structured reasoning: systems, algorithms, abstraction
* **Affective** – Identity, equity, error framing, authorship
* **Routines** – Recurrent practices: journaling, blogging, AI reflection

Each cell below is tagged:

* `I` = Introduced
* `R` = Reinforced
* `X` = Practiced outside class
* `F` = Spirals forward in course

## Conceptual Thread Index

**Technical Threads**
`t-shell` — Shell fluency (bash, file nav)
`t-git` — Version control
`t-markup` — Markdown / markup writing
`t-diagram` — System diagramming

**Cognitive Threads**
`c-systems` — Systems thinking
`c-algo` — Algorithmic reasoning
`c-abstract` — Abstraction, naming, clarity
`c-meta` — Metacognition, reflection on thinking

**Affective Threads**
`a-self` — Self-efficacy, error as learning
`a-rep` — Representation + critique
`a-auth` — AI authorship + digital discernment

**Routine Threads**
`r-journal` — Journaling practices
`r-blog` — Public blog in markdown
`r-ai` — AI prompt reflection, authorship norms

## Notes for Future Integration

* Threads marked `X` must have access points via handouts, guides, or practice platforms.
* Threads marked `F` (future spirals) will be incorporated into Unit 1 and beyond.
* This map will be updated as lesson order shifts or threads condense.

The ThreadMap functions as both instructional design record and coherence tool: a curriculum is not a set of topics—it’s a *pattern of recurrence.*
