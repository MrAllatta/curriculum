## Unit 2: Data Science and Representation (Pyret)
**Framing Concept: Data is a constructed lens on the world.**

### Unit Overview
In this unit, students transition from function-based design to working with structured data. Using Pyret and Bootstrap’s Data Science tools, students learn to filter, transform, and visualize real-world datasets. We treat data not as neutral, but as a model—a system of choices, omissions, and interpretations. The goal is to build technical skill *and* analytical power: students should be able to manipulate data **and** ask, "What is this data saying—and not saying—about the world?"

### Essential Questions
- What does it mean to model a world with data?
- How do we clean, filter, and transform data programmatically?
- What categories exist in data, and who defines them?
- What is the relationship between structure and interpretation?

### Core Learning Goals
- Read, query, and transform datasets using Pyret
- Use `filter`, `map`, and `build-column` to explore collections
- Create meaningful visualizations (bar graphs, pie charts, etc.)
- Analyze bias, omission, and representation in data design
- Connect computational work to civic and institutional structures

### Core Activities
- Investigate a museum dataset (e.g., the Met): Who’s represented?
- Explore how filters change what we see
- Design a “Re-curated Exhibit” based on a new interpretation
- Mini-lectures on categories, aggregation, and curation logic
- Graph interpretation and critique as a weekly routine

### Transfer and Syntax Shift
Students move from Racket to Pyret syntax, but retain functional reasoning. This transition emphasizes that **conceptual fluency transcends syntax.** It also stresses the need for reading documentation and understanding new environments—skills essential to any computational future.

### Stretch + Extensions
- Students bring in their own dataset of interest (music, books, school policies)
- Join datasets to explore intersections (e.g., geography + art)
- Use computed columns to create new derived fields
- Optional introduction to categorical encoding and sorting

### Assessment and Reflection
- Annotated visualization: What do you see, and why?
- Data diary: What decisions did you make to prepare and clean your dataset?
- Weekly journal: Where else do you see filtered or curated data in your life?
- Vocabulary check: "record," "field," "filter," "category," "visualization"

### End-of-Unit Statement
By the end of Unit 3, students understand that data is never “raw.” They see that every data set reflects a worldview. They have learned how to ask meaningful questions, shape their data to reflect those questions, and communicate the results clearly. They are now ready to re-engage with control flow and state in a new language—bringing their structure and insight with them.
