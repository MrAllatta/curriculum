## Assessment Map by Unit
*Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning*

This map outlines the core assessments and artifacts for each unit. Each task is designed to capture student reasoning, not just product or performance.

---

### Unit 1: The Story of Data
- \* \*Journal Prompts\* — interpret computing news and graph visuals
- \* \*Diagram Task\* — represent a system (human or technical)
- \* \*Vocabulary Check\* — define abstraction, encoding, protocol
- \* \*Discussion Participation\* — computing as a human system

---

### Unit 2: Programming by Design (Racket)
- \* \*Design Recipe Submission\* — with contract, examples, tests
- \* \*Code Review Check\* — peer feedback on recursive or `cond` logic
- \* \*Visual Pattern Generator\* — recursive drawing or modeling task
- \* \*Reflection Writing\* — what makes a function "well-designed"

---

### Unit 3: Data Science and Representation (Pyret)
- \* \*Dataset Exploration\* — filtering and transforming with `map`, `filter`
- \* \*Annotated Visualization\* — chart with rationale and critique
- \* \*Data Ethics Prompt\* — reflect on omission, bias, or category design
- \* \*Vocabulary Check\* — record, field, filter, visualization

---

### Unit 4: Systems and Control (Python + EarSketch)
- \* \*EarSketch Performance\* — explain structure + logic of music system
- \* \*Simulation Code\* — loop and conditional-based model
- \* \*Logic Trace\* — student explains program line by line
- \* \*Debugging Task\* — fix and annotate broken accumulator logic

---

### Unit 5: Interface and Communication (HTML + CSS)
- \* \*Portfolio Page\* — present prior work with narrative and design
- \* \*Design Critique\* — peer review of structure and clarity
- \* \*Self-Assessment\* — which design choices served communication?
- \* \*Checklist Completion\* — accessibility and semantic structure

---

### Unit 6: Code in the Wild (Jupyter + APIs)
- \* \*Notebook Submission\* — with question, code, output, and narrative
- \* \*Peer Presentation\* — walk through a peer's analysis aloud
- \* \*Metadata Prompt\* — what data did you leave out, and why?
- \* \*API Walkthrough\* — explain how the data was fetched and used

---

### Unit 7: Networks, Protocols, and Power
- \* \*Protocol Map\* — diagram how a web request travels through abstraction layers
- \* \*Metadata Log\* — what is exposed in each transmission?
- \* \*Discussion Participation\* — ethics of routing, DNS, infrastructure
- \* \*Concept Map\* — connect networks to power, equity, and design

---

### Unit 8: Capstone Projects
- \* \*Final Artifact\* — program, site, simulation, or data story
- \* \*Documentation Packet\* — logic explanation and technical breakdown
- \* \*Reflective Essay\* — what you built, why, and what it shows
- \* \*Peer Review Rubric\* — revision notes and response to critique

---

Each assessment emphasizes clarity, defense of reasoning, and self-awareness in design.
