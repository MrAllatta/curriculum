# Instructor Implementation Guide

*Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning*

**Audience:** Teachers implementing the CS9 course as designed by Eric Allatta
**Format:** Modular, full-year, project-based
**Core Themes:** Structure before syntax, data as interpretation, code as communication

## Year-at-a-Glance

| Quarter | Units                                                    | Focus                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Q1      | Unit 1 – Story of Data<br>Unit 2 – Programming by Design | Foundations: structure, functions, recursion |
| Q2      | Unit 3 – Data Science<br>Unit 4 – Systems + Control      | Real-world modeling: filtering, loops, state |
| Q3      | Unit 5 – Interface<br>Unit 6 – APIs + Inquiry            | Communication + systems thinking             |
| Q4      | Unit 7 – Networks + Power<br>Unit 8 – Capstone           | Infrastructure + synthesis                   |

## Pacing Guidance

* Each unit spans \~3 weeks, with some stretch/flex time built in
* Units 1 and 8 are foundational and reflective—allow for more discussion and writing
* Units 2–4 build technical fluency; they require patience, clarity, and routine

## Environments + Tools

| Unit | Tools                                  |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2    | Racket (DrRacket or online IDE)        |
| 3    | Pyret (code.pyret.org)                 |
| 4    | Python (EarSketch, then vanilla)       |
| 5    | HTML/CSS (repl.it, Glitch, or VS Code) |
| 6    | Jupyter or Google Colab                |
| 7    | Code.org Internet Sim, optional CLI    |

## Differentiation Strategies

* **Functional-first units** (1–3) are cognitively demanding but equitable: scaffold with peer design checks and verbal code traces
* **Python state units** benefit from physical metaphors (machines, containers, systems)
* **Capstone and interface work** reward creative expression—build in student choice early to scaffold independence

## Common Student Challenges

| Challenge             | Strategy                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recursion confusion   | Anchor in visual examples (e.g. flags, trees), connect to function tracing   |
| Conditionals overload | Use real-world filters, classroom simulations (e.g., "who leaves the room?") |
| API overwhelm         | Scaffold with fixed URLs, predictable data shape, and prefilled cells        |
| “What do I build?”    | Revisit past projects—offer remix tracks, not open ocean                     |

---

## Threads to Reinforce

* Consistency in testing + design before build (from Unit 2 forward)
* Journal + data reflection across units (anchor writing + sensemaking)
* Always name the idea before teaching the syntax (structure → semantics → syntax)

## Final Thoughts

This course is built for fluency and reflection. You’ll move slowly at the start—and that’s good. Trust the arc, name the concepts, and help students see their thinking evolve.
