# Syllabus Appendix: Selected Unit Summaries

This appendix provides expanded descriptions of key units from the 9th grade course *Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning*. Each unit summary includes conceptual framing, core learning goals, representative activities, and assessments to support instructional planning and curricular alignment.

## Unit 1: The Story of Data

**Framing Concept:** Programming is communication between humans and machines.

Students begin with the epistemological and historical foundations of computing. Through readings, visual mapping, and structured discussion, they engage with the idea that computation is designed, contextual, and cultural. Activities include human-algorithm exercises, computing in the news, and interpretive graph reading.

**Key Outcomes:**

* Understand data as structured representation
* Build foundational metaphors (system, abstraction, encoding)
* Introduce equity and underrepresentation in computing history

---

## Unit 2: Programming by Design (Racket)

**Framing Concept:** A program is a structured solution to a problem.

Students use Racket to design pure functions using the design recipe: contract, examples, definition, and tests. They build recursive and piecewise functions and apply them to visual and mathematical models.

**Key Outcomes:**

* Write and explain testable functions
* Practice decomposition and reuse
* Begin recursive reasoning aligned with algebraic logic

## Unit 3: Data Science and Representation (Pyret)

**Framing Concept:** Data is a constructed lens on the world.

Students manipulate tabular datasets to explore representation and omission. They apply `filter`, `map`, and `build-column` functions to real museum or cultural datasets. Data visualizations support critical interpretation.

**Key Outcomes:**

* Use Boolean expressions and functions to analyze data
* Create and critique graphs and transformations
* Explore the role of categorization and metadata in shaping knowledge

---

## Unit 4: Systems and Control (Python + EarSketch)

**Framing Concept:** Programs model dynamic systems through control flow and state.

Students shift into procedural thinking using loops, conditionals, and accumulators. In EarSketch, they create rule-based sound compositions; in vanilla Python, they simulate behaviors and interactive systems.

**Key Outcomes:**

* Write code using `for`, `while`, `if/else` constructs
* Understand mutation, state, and behavior
* Trace and debug procedural logic with intention

## Capstone Project Preview

The course concludes with an independent capstone. Students synthesize learning through a data inquiry, system simulation, or interface project. Each project must be built, explained, and defended in a public or peer-reviewed format.

**Capstone Deliverables:**

* Final artifact (code, visualization, simulation)
* Technical documentation
* Reflective writing on process and impact
