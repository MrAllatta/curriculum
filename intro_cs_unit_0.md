**Unit 0: The Story of Data**

**Course:** Programming by Design: Computing, Representation, and Reasoning
**Grade Level:** 9th
**Duration:** \~4 weeks
**Theme:** Computing as communication and cultural expression
**Core Concept:** Programming exists because humans and machines think differently. Code is structured language that translates intent into action. This unit develops foundational habits of thought, historical context, and early computational metaphors.

---

### Essential Questions

* What is computation, and why does it exist?
* How do computers interpret instructions?
* What is data, and how does it gain meaning?
* Who has shaped the field of computing, and whose stories are missing?
* How do we begin to reason about problems structurally?

---

### Learning Objectives

Students will:

* Build conceptual understanding of computing as a human-centered system
* Explore the cultural and historical origins of computer science
* Learn foundational vocabulary and metaphors of systems, data, and abstraction
* Establish classroom habits: critical analysis, precision, structured expression
* Begin diagramming systems and expressing structured instructions (algorithms)

---

### Core Routines

* **Computing in the News**: Weekly student-led exploration of current tech headlines
* **What's Going On in This Graph?**: Visual literacy and data interpretation starter
* **Notebooking**: Diagramming, journaling, defining terms, sketching systems
* **Meta-discussion**: Weekly “thinking about thinking” debriefs

---

### Anchor Activities

1. **The Human Algorithm Game**
   Students write and perform step-by-step directions for each other. Debrief precision, assumptions, and ambiguity.

2. **What is a Computer?** (Concept Mapping + Debate)
   Collaborative brainstorm of mental models, followed by group critique.

3. **Historical Spotlight: Ada Lovelace + Grace Hopper**
   Primary source excerpts and discussion on gender, exclusion, and vision in computing.

4. **Binary and Machine Language Simulation**
   Introduce core abstraction idea: everything can be encoded. Contrast with human language.

5. **System Walkthroughs**
   Tour and annotate real-world systems (school schedule, cafeteria line, museum layout) to practice systems-level observation.

---

### Extension Opportunities

* Analyze a museum exhibit as a data system: what is preserved, omitted, or emphasized?
* Write a prompt for a generative AI system. What makes a prompt successful or ambiguous?
* Build a “thinking tool” that translates a human request into simple steps (pseudocode, diagram, or language model)
* Use a logic grid puzzle as a metaphor for constraint-based reasoning

---

### Assessments

* **Diagram Task**: Students create a visual map of a process or system, labeled and explained
* **Vocabulary Check**: Students self-assess and demonstrate mastery of key terms (e.g., abstraction, system, algorithm)
* **Reflection Writing**: What does it mean to write something a computer can follow?
* **Participation Rubric**: Discussion quality, journal maintenance, peer feedback

### End-of-Unit Reflection

Students understand that computing is not about devices or apps—it’s about structured thought. They see programming not as code but as structured communication with a machine, grounded in logic and clarity. They have the intellectual footing—and the humility—to begin.
