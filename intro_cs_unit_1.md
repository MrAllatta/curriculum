**Unit 1: Programming by Design (Racket)**
*Framing Concept: A program is a structured solution to a problem.*

---

**Unit Overview:**
This unit introduces students to programming through a function-first, design-oriented approach. The goal is not just to "write code," but to understand what makes a solution correct, clear, and adaptable. Students build mental models for inputs, outputs, structure, and testing. Using a Beginning Student Language (Racket) and the design recipe, students gain fluency in creating small, testable, purpose-driven programs that reinforce algebraic reasoning and prepare them for later work in data, control systems, and abstraction.

**Essential Questions:**

* What makes a program correct?
* How do we decompose a problem into smaller parts?
* How do we describe what a program is supposed to do?
* Why does testing matter, and how do we do it well?
* What do functions have in common with mathematical expressions?

---

**Core Learning Goals:**

* Use the design recipe: purpose statement, contract, examples/tests, definition
* Understand and apply function composition and reuse
* Write and test simple and piecewise functions
* Use `cond` expressions to handle branching behavior
* Understand recursion conceptually and apply it to visual or numerical patterns

---

**Key Activities:**

* **Function Design Practice:** Start with simple input/output transformations, model arithmetic, unit conversion, or basic geometry
* **Flag Generator Project:** Use recursive visual patterns and decomposition to model a US flag
* **Function Towers:** Stack smaller functions into pipelines (function composition)
* **Visual Recursion:** Draw fractal-like patterns using self-referential design
* **Peer Reviews:** Students review and annotate each other's design recipe steps

---

**Embedded Mathematical Connections:**

* Functions as input-output rules (from Algebra 1)
* Recursion modeled after arithmetic sequences or pattern growth
* Piecewise definitions connected to real-world mathematical modeling
* Building a function from a table of values or from verbal description

---

**Stretch + Extensions:**

* **Recursive Tree Generator:** Visualize recursion via branching logic
* **Build-a-Bot:** Design a command language for a robot with movement functions
* **Algebra Word Problem Parser:** Model small parts of word problems as testable functions
* **Abstracting Repetition:** Recognize patterns and create general-purpose utilities

---

**Assessment + Reflection:**

* Design check-in: Students annotate their own thinking at each recipe step
* Vocabulary quiz: Define function, contract, test case, recursion, abstraction
* Code review: Present and defend a recursive or piecewise function to peers
* Reflection: How is this different from other math you’ve done? What new habits do you notice forming?

**End-of-Unit Statement:**
By the end of Unit 2, students should be able to write a variety of pure functions, test them meaningfully, and explain the structure of their programs. They begin to see programming not as a trick or a task, but as a structured act of problem solving. This is their first real fluency checkpoint in the course—and it sets them up to apply structure in more open-ended and data-rich settings next.
