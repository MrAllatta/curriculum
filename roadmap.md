Here's a structured **roadmap** for building your **curriculum site from archives** using GPT while minimizing babysitting.

---

## **Phase 1: Define Structure & Goals (Planning)**
### **1. Project Scope**
- Define the **sections and pages** needed for the site.
- Categorize the **types of content** youâ€™ll pull from archives (e.g., lesson plans, exercises, student work, reflections).
- Decide on **formatting standards** (e.g., Markdown for Jekyll, HTML templates).

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Help me outline a structured curriculum site using my archive materials. Identify the main sections, how lesson plans should be formatted, and how materials should be categorized."

### **2. Identify Automation Opportunities**
- What tasks are repetitive? (e.g., file conversion, content formatting)
- What steps require GPTâ€™s help?
- Which parts can be **scripted** instead of manually requested?

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Given that I need to convert and organize my archive into a curriculum site, identify steps that can be fully automated with scripts vs. steps that require manual intervention."

---

## **Phase 2: Batch Content Processing**
### **3. Extract & Convert Archive Materials**
- **Step A:** List all raw materials.
- **Step B:** Determine a **standard format** for each type of document.
- **Step C:** Generate a script to **bulk convert** raw documents into formatted Markdown.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Generate a script to batch process my archive files into Markdown format for Jekyll. Assume input files are in varied formats (Google Docs, PDFs, text files)."

---

### **4. Generate Standardized Lesson Plan Templates**
- Create a **consistent lesson plan format**.
- Ensure it includes **learning objectives, activities, student work samples**.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Design a standardized lesson plan template for my curriculum site. It should include sections for objectives, activities, and student work."

- Use GPT to **batch convert** raw lesson notes into this template.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Take the following raw lesson notes and convert them into my standardized lesson plan format."

---

### **5. Identify and Extract Key Evidence of Impact**
- Review archives for **student success stories, assessments, or project outcomes**.
- Create a structured way to **highlight impact** on the site.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Extract meaningful evidence of student impact from the following teaching artifacts. Format it into a structured 'Evidence of Impact' section."

---

## **Phase 3: Site Assembly**
### **6. Generate Jekyll-Compatible Markdown Files**
- Organize materials into **Jekyll post/page structure**.
- Generate **metadata** (titles, categories, tags) for each page.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Generate Jekyll-compatible Markdown files for my curriculum content. Assign logical titles, categories, and front matter."

---

### **7. Automate Site Navigation & Linking**
- Generate a **Table of Contents** dynamically.
- Ensure **internal linking** between related lessons.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Analyze my curriculum site structure and generate an internal linking strategy. Suggest a navigation bar and sidebar organization."

---

### **8. Run a Batch Validation Check**
- Identify errors in **formatting, broken links, or missing sections**.
- Use a script to **check for missing metadata**.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Analyze my converted curriculum site content for missing sections, inconsistent formatting, and broken links. Suggest fixes."

---

## **Phase 4: Iteration & Deployment**
### **9. Review & Improve Site Content**
- Refine lesson plans with **GPT-assisted improvements**.
- Ensure readability and clarity.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Review and improve the following lesson plan for clarity and engagement."

---

### **10. Automate Site Deployment**
- Set up GitHub Pages or Netlify for **automatic deployment**.
- Use a script to **sync new content updates**.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Generate a deployment script that automatically updates my Jekyll site on GitHub Pages when new content is added."

---

## **Phase 5: Expansion & Maintenance**
### **11. Document Workflow for Future Updates**
- Write clear instructions on **adding new content**.
- Set up a workflow to **review and refine** the curriculum periodically.

**â†’ GPT Prompt:**
> "Generate a contributor guide that explains how to add new curriculum materials to my Jekyll site."

---

## **Final Notes**
ðŸ”¹ **Batch Process Everything** â€“ Work on multiple files at once instead of step-by-step babysitting.  
ðŸ”¹ **Preemptively Debug with GPT** â€“ Ask for failure points **before** running conversions.  
ðŸ”¹ **Use Scripts Where Possible** â€“ Automate formatting, file conversions, and deployments.  
ðŸ”¹ **Leverage GPT for Review Instead of Fixing Afterward** â€“ Have it generate well-structured files from the start.
